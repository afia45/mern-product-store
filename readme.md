# Product Store built with MERN Stack
![Screen shots](/assets/1.png)
This is a Product Store application built using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The app allows the admin to **create**, **edit**, **update**, and **delete** products in the store. It connects the server side to the client side, handling all requests sent by the user efficiently. The application also handles errors gracefully using `try` and `catch` blocks to ensure smooth interactions and reliable functionality.

## Features:
- Admin panel for managing products
- Create, update, delete products
- Handle user and admin requests seamlessly
- Error handling with try and catch blocks
- Built an API
